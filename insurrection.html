                Deviantech is the sole owner of a completed location-based iPhone game.
                We don't have the necessary iPhone development skills or marketing clout in-house to launch the app, so we're looking to partner with an
                established iPhone development shop that can take over where our expertise leaves off.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additional info about the game is included below, but if you're interested in learning more
                please <a href="contact.html">get in touch with us</a>.
                After you sign an NDA we'll send you the codebase and more detailed information, including the following:
                <ul>
                  <li>Explanation of the story line</li>

              <p>
                The app, named Insurrection, is an immersive location-based game that's played in real life with the assistance of the players' iPhones.
                It has an entire backstory (the year is 2035, there's been an economic collapse and subsequent militaristic government takeover, the
                players are insurrectionists working against the government, etc. etc.), but basically players use the iPhone's GPS capabilities to
                check-in and "arrest" other players who are located nearby.  Although it's much more involved than this, the basic gist is a continuous,
                globe-spanning game of tag.

              <p>
                Our expertise is in Ruby on Rails web development, so we built the backend ourselves.  We were originally working with two other parties
                (a front-end iPhone developer and someone handling the business/marketing side of things), but both of them had to drop the project for personal reasons.
              </p>
              <p>
                We are now the sole owners of the game and codebase, but we aren't iPhone developers and we aren't in a position to successfully market and support the
                game going forward.  We work on a number of different projects, and since developing the game we've taken on a few large web clients who are currently
                approaching or in the midst of launch... basically, we don't have the time or resources to devote to this game at the moment, but we believe it has
                amazing potential and it's so close to being finished that it would be a shame not to see it move forward.

                <h2>
                  <span>What</span>
                  We're Looking For
                </h2>
              </div>
              <p>
                We're looking for an iPhone game development shop that can take over ownership of the project and push it to the next level.
                Ideally this shop would have developers specializing in both Rails and iOS development to put the final touches on it and support the game post-launch
                (taking user feedback into account, adding new features, etc.), but since the game would be most successful with a large
                userbase our primary consideration is a shop with some marketing clout.
              </p>
              <p>
                The development is 98% done (the app has been completed and tested with a few players, but hasn't undergone extensive testing with a large userbase), so after a few minor
                tweaks it would be ready for launch.  We also have a pretty clear roadmap laid out for version two, which introduces a number of new cooperative gameplay
                elements as well as in-app purchases for in-game ability modifiers, so there's plenty of room to expand the revenue streams moving forward.
              </p>
